# React Aria Tech Sample <br/><small>_by_ ‹div›RIOTS</small>

This is a _Technology Sample_ you can rely on to build your own Design System, based on React and [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/).

**Disclaimer**: _Technology Samples_ aren't comprehensive _Design Systems_ but showcases a given technology so you free to build you own solution upon it.

## Architecture

This _tech sample_ uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) to implement its components with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It relies on [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/), which is a part of the _Adobe Spectrum Design System_. React Aria provides a collection of _React Hooks_ to handle the accessibility and navigation behaviors, allowing you to set a proper interaction layer for all of your components.

> React Aria ensures consistent behavior, no matter the UI.

> React Aria provides accessibility and behavior according to WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, including full screen reader and keyboard navigation support.

Because of the agnostic nature of React Aria, the Design Tokens for styling are declared in [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*).

The components then use [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) for their internal styles, relying on CSS Custom Properties for Tokens access.

### Tokens

The Tokens are split in different components:

- `typography`: fonts definitions
- `colors`: colors and variants
- `spacing`: relative and absolute spaces
- `elevation`: shadows effects
- `border-radius`
- `transitions`: easing and speed
- `z-index`: z-axe indices

All tokens are declared in dedicated `_*.scss` files in their dedicated tokens' components. They declare CSS Custom Properties, prefixed with `--aria-*`. They're then all exposed by the `all/all.scss` component global stylesheet.

Your theme tokens are accessible by importing the theme stylesheet:

```ts
import '~/all/src/all.scss';
```

## Components

Components can access the Tokens anywhere in their stylesheets as they're exposed at top CSS level `:root`.

When styled with SCSS, components can use the [Sass `var` method](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/css-vars) to read the Tokens values.

```scss
.button {
  border-radius: var(--aria-border-radius-medium);
  background: var(--aria-color-primary);
  color: var(--aria-color-white);
}
```

Then the styles are imported in the component using a CSS in React module interpolation:

```ts
import styles from './button.module.scss';

export const Button => (
  <button className={`${styles.button}`}>
    // ...
  </button>
)
```

## Stories

Stories are written in Storybook's [Component Story Format](https://backlight.dev/docs/component-story-format).

The theme stylesheet containing the Tokens is injected in all stories files, thanks to the `story-layout` component:

```jsx
import '~/story-layout';
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '../index';

export const primary = () => <Button>Primary</Button>;
```

Stories for the components are located in their `stories/` folder.

## Documentation

Documentation pages are decorated by a React layout using the [@divriots/dockit-react](https://github.com/divriots/dockit-react) helpers. See the `mdx-layout` component.

### Pages

Each component embed its own documentation in its `doc/` folder. You can use any web format for your documentation but we recommend you to write it with the [mdx](https://backlight.dev/docs/mdx) format, allowing you to embed your components live in the documentation.
